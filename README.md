# ms-comp-challenge-1
## Synopsis
This project required the design of a static, fully responsive website, based on the original comp provided below. My version matches the layout of the original comp, but differs in color scheme, themes, and copy. In addition, the flexibility of the design as one moves to a tablet-size or mobile version was my responsibility to create and execute.
